# Chapter 7: Understanding Ownership

## Introduction

One of Rust's most distinctive features is its ownership system, which enables memory safety without garbage collection. This chapter introduces you to Rust's unique approach to memory management and explains how ownership works.

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- How different programming languages manage memory
- Why memory management is crucial for performance and reliability
- Rust's ownership rules and how they prevent common programming errors
- How memory is organized in your computer
- The mechanics of variable scope and cleanup
- Move semantics and their implications
- When to clone data instead of moving it
- How to debug ownership-related issues

## Memory Management Approaches Across Languages

To appreciate Rust's ownership system, it's helpful to understand how other programming languages manage memory.

### Manual Memory Management

Languages like C and C++ give programmers direct control over memory allocation and deallocation:

```c
// C example
int* create_array(int size) {
    int* array = malloc(size * sizeof(int)); // Manual allocation
    return array;
}

void use_array() {
    int* my_array = create_array(10);
    // Use the array...
    free(my_array); // Manual deallocation
    // Dangerous: my_array is now a dangling pointer
}
```

This approach offers performance benefits but can lead to several problems:

- **Memory leaks**: Forgetting to free memory
- **Use-after-free**: Using memory after it's been freed
- **Double-free**: Freeing the same memory multiple times
- **Buffer overflows**: Accessing memory beyond allocated bounds

### Garbage Collection

Languages like Java, Python, JavaScript, and C# use garbage collection:

```java
// Java example
void createAndUseList() {
    ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    list.add(42);
    // No need to free memory manually
} // Garbage collector will eventually reclaim memory
```

Garbage collection eliminates memory leaks and use-after-free bugs but introduces other trade-offs:

- **Performance overhead**: GC pauses can cause latency spikes
- **Memory overhead**: GC typically requires more memory
- **Unpredictable execution times**: Hard to predict when GC will run

### Reference Counting

Languages like Swift and Python (for some objects) use reference counting:

```swift
// Swift example
class MyResource {
    var data = [1, 2, 3]
}

func useResource() {
    let a = MyResource() // Reference count = 1
    let b = a            // Reference count = 2
    // When variables go out of scope, reference count decreases
} // When count reaches 0, memory is freed
```

Reference counting provides deterministic cleanup but has these drawbacks:

- **Runtime overhead**: Updating reference counts
- **Cyclic references**: Can cause memory leaks

## Why Memory Management Matters

Memory management affects several critical aspects of software:

1. **Performance**: Efficient memory use improves speed and responsiveness
2. **Resource usage**: Proper management reduces memory consumption
3. **Reliability**: Good memory management prevents crashes and data corruption
4. **Security**: Many security vulnerabilities stem from memory management bugs
5. **Predictability**: Consistent memory behavior leads to deterministic programs

In today's computing landscape, these factors matter for different reasons:

- **Embedded systems** have severe memory constraints
- **Mobile applications** need to be battery-efficient
- **Game development** requires consistent frame rates without pauses
- **Server applications** need to handle many requests without excessive memory use
- **Security-critical software** must prevent exploitable memory bugs

## The Problem with Garbage Collection and Manual Memory Management

### Issues with Garbage Collection

While garbage collection has made programming more accessible, it comes with significant drawbacks:

1. **Non-deterministic cleanup**: You can't predict when memory will be freed
2. **Pause times**: Applications may freeze during garbage collection
3. **Resource constraints**: Not suitable for memory-constrained environments
4. **Resource management beyond memory**: GC doesn't handle file handles, network connections, etc.
5. **Performance overhead**: Tracking object lifetimes consumes CPU and memory

### Issues with Manual Memory Management

Manual memory management provides control but introduces significant risks:

1. **Human error**: Programmers make mistakes in memory management
2. **Cognitive burden**: Tracking allocations and deallocations is difficult
3. **Security vulnerabilities**: Memory errors lead to exploitable vulnerabilities
4. **Debugging difficulty**: Memory bugs can be hard to track down
5. **Code complexity**: Error handling for memory operations clutters code

## Ownership Rules Explained

Rust takes a fundamentally different approach to memory management. Instead of relying on manual tracking or garbage collection, Rust enforces memory safety through compile-time rules about ownership.

### Rust's Ownership Rules

In Rust, memory management follows three key rules:

1. Each value has a single **owner**
2. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped
3. Ownership can be transferred (**moved**), but there can only be one owner at a time

Let's see these rules in action:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Rule 1: Each value has a single owner
    let s1 = String::from("hello"); // s1 owns the String

    // Rule 3: Ownership can be transferred
    let s2 = s1; // s1's ownership is moved to s2

    // This would cause a compile error because s1 no longer owns anything
    // println!("{}", s1);

    // This works because s2 is the owner
    println!("{}", s2);

    // Rule 2: When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped
} // s2 goes out of scope, the String is automatically dropped
```

These rules are enforced at compile-time, with no runtime overhead. This is Rust's big innovation: memory safety without garbage collection.

### Benefits of Ownership

Rust's ownership system provides numerous benefits:

1. **No garbage collector**: Predictable performance without pauses
2. **No manual memory management**: No need to call `free` or `delete`
3. **Memory safety**: No use-after-free, double-free, or memory leaks
4. **Thread safety**: Data races are prevented at compile time
5. **Efficient resource management**: Resources are released as soon as they're no longer needed

## The Stack and the Heap

To understand ownership, we need to understand how memory is organized in a computer.

### Stack Memory

The stack is a region of memory with last-in, first-out (LIFO) access:

- **Fast operations**: Push and pop operations are very fast
- **Fixed-size data**: Each piece of data must have a known, fixed size
- **Limited scope**: Perfect for function-local variables
- **Automatic cleanup**: Data is automatically removed when a function returns

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 42; // Stored on the stack
    let y = true; // Stored on the stack
    let z = 3.14; // Stored on the stack
} // x, y, and z are popped off the stack
```

### Heap Memory

The heap is a more flexible but slower region of memory:

- **Dynamic size**: Can store data whose size isn't known at compile time
- **Slower allocation**: Finding space for new data takes more time
- **Global access**: Data can be accessed from anywhere in your program
- **Manual management**: In most languages, you must explicitly free heap data

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello"); // Data stored on the heap, pointer on stack
} // s is dropped, which frees the heap memory
```

### Visual Representation

Here's how stack and heap memory look in a simple Rust program:

```
Stack                      Heap
+------------------+       +------------------+
| s -> pointer  ------------> "hello\0"       |
+------------------+       +------------------+
| x = 42           |
+------------------+
| y = true         |
+------------------+
| z = 3.14         |
+------------------+
```

For stack-only data like integers, booleans, and floating-point numbers, the value is stored directly on the stack. For heap data like String, a pointer is stored on the stack, but the actual data lives on the heap.

## Variable Scope and Drop

In Rust, variables are valid only within their scope, and resources are automatically cleaned up when they go out of scope.

### Variable Scope

A scope is the range of code where a variable is valid:

```rust
fn main() {
    // s is not valid here - it hasn't been declared yet

    {
        // This is a new scope
        let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point

        println!("{}", s); // We can use s here

        // s is still valid here
    } // This scope is now over, and s is no longer valid

    // s is not valid here - it's out of scope
    // println!("{}", s); // This would be a compile error
}
```

### The Drop Function

When a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically calls a special function called `drop`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    // s is used here

} // s goes out of scope, drop() is called, memory is freed
```

This automatic cleanup is similar to the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern in C++. It ensures that resources are freed exactly when they're no longer needed, without any explicit calls to free or delete.

### Visualizing Drop

Here's what happens when a String is dropped:

```
Before drop:

Stack                      Heap
+------------------+       +------------------+
| s -> pointer  ------------> "hello\0"       |
+------------------+       +------------------+

After drop:

Stack                      Heap
+------------------+
| (s no longer     |       (Memory freed)
|  exists)         |
+------------------+
```

The drop function automatically frees both the memory on the stack and the memory on the heap.

## Move Semantics with Examples

In Rust, when you assign a value from one variable to another, the ownership is transferred—this is called a "move."

### Basic Move Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // Ownership moves from s1 to s2

    // This would cause a compile error:
    // println!("{}", s1); // Error: s1 has been moved

    // This is valid:
    println!("{}", s2); // Works: s2 now owns the string
}
```

### Visual Representation of a Move

Before the move:

```
s1 -> pointer -> "hello"
```

After the move:

```
s1 -> invalidated
s2 -> pointer -> "hello"
```

The key insight is that Rust doesn't copy the heap data. Instead, it invalidates the first variable and transfers ownership to the second variable. This prevents double-free errors and ensures each piece of memory has exactly one owner.

### Move in Function Calls

Ownership can also be transferred when passing values to functions:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    take_ownership(s); // Ownership of s is moved to the function

    // This would cause a compile error:
    // println!("{}", s); // Error: s has been moved
}

fn take_ownership(some_string: String) {
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // some_string goes out of scope and is dropped
```

### Returning Ownership

Functions can also return ownership:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = give_ownership(); // Receive ownership from function

    let s2 = String::from("hello");
    let s3 = take_and_give_back(s2); // s2 is moved, then a new value is returned

    println!("{} and {}", s1, s3);
    // This would be a compile error:
    // println!("{}", s2); // Error: s2 has been moved
}

fn give_ownership() -> String {
    let s = String::from("yours");
    s // ownership is transferred to the caller
}

fn take_and_give_back(s: String) -> String {
    s // return ownership to the caller
}
```

## Clone and Copy Traits

Sometimes you want to duplicate data rather than move it. Rust provides two ways to do this: `Clone` and `Copy`.

### Making Deep Copies with Clone

If you want to duplicate data on the heap rather than move it, you can use the `clone` method:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone(); // Creates a deep copy of s1

    // Both are valid because s2 is a completely new String:
    println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
}
```

Cloning creates a new allocation on the heap with the same contents as the original. This is explicit and potentially expensive, especially for large data structures.

### Visual Representation of Clone

```
Before clone:
s1 -> Heap: "hello"

After clone:
s1 -> Heap: "hello"
s2 -> Heap: "hello" (separate allocation)
```

### The Copy Trait for Stack-Only Data

For simple types that are entirely stored on the stack, Rust provides the `Copy` trait:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = x; // x is copied to y, not moved

    // Both are valid because integers are Copy:
    println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
}
```

When a type implements the `Copy` trait, the original variable is still valid after assignment. The assignment creates a simple, fast copy of the bits.

Types that implement the `Copy` trait include:

- All integer types (`i32`, `u64`, etc.)
- Boolean type (`bool`)
- Floating point types (`f32`, `f64`)
- Character type (`char`)
- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`
- Arrays and fixed-size arrays of `Copy` types

### Making Custom Types Copy

You can make your own types implement `Copy` if all their fields are `Copy`:

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
    let p2 = p1; // p1 is copied to p2, not moved

    // Both are valid:
    println!("p1: ({}, {}), p2: ({}, {})", p1.x, p1.y, p2.x, p2.y);
}
```

Types that contain heap data (like `String` or `Vec`) cannot implement `Copy` because copying them requires allocating memory.

### Copy vs. Clone

| Trait  | Operation | Cost       | Usage                                |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| `Copy` | Implicit  | Very cheap | Stack-only data, small types         |
| `Clone`| Explicit  | Can be costly | Any type, including heap data     |

As a rule of thumb:
- Use `Copy` for types that are cheap to duplicate
- Use `Clone` when you explicitly want to duplicate data that might be expensive to copy

## Ownership and Functions

Let's explore how ownership works with functions in more detail.

### Passing Ownership to Functions

When you pass a value to a function, the ownership rules still apply:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    
    print_and_drop(s); // Ownership is transferred
    
    // This would be a compile error:
    // println!("{}", s); // Error: s has been moved
}

fn print_and_drop(some_string: String) {
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // some_string goes out of scope and is dropped
```

When `s` is passed to `print_and_drop`, ownership moves into the function parameter `some_string`. When the function ends, `some_string` goes out of scope and the string is dropped.

### Return Values and Ownership

Functions can also return ownership:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    
    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);
    
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len();
    (s, length) // Return both the string and its length
}
```

This pattern of passing ownership back and forth would be tedious if we had to do it for every function call. That's why Rust has the concept of references, which we'll explore in the next chapter.

### Ownership and Multiple Return Values

Returning multiple values can be used to give back ownership of values passed to a function:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = String::from("world");
    
    let (s1, s2, combined) = combine_strings(s1, s2);
    
    println!("Combined '{}' and '{}' into '{}'", s1, s2, combined);
}

fn combine_strings(s1: String, s2: String) -> (String, String, String) {
    let combined = format!("{} {}", s1, s2);
    
    // Return ownership of all three strings
    (s1, s2, combined)
}
```

### Scopes and Ownership Flow

It's helpful to visualize the flow of ownership as values move between scopes:

```
┌─ main() scope ──────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│  let s = String::from("hello")              │
│  s owns "hello"                             │
│                                             │
│  ┌─ print_and_drop() scope ───────────┐     │
│  │                                    │     │
│  │  some_string owns "hello"          │     │
│  │  (ownership transferred from s)    │     │
│  │                                    │     │
│  └────────────────────────────────────┘     │
│  "hello" is dropped when print_and_drop ends │
│                                             │
│  // s no longer owns anything               │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Understanding this flow of ownership is crucial for writing effective Rust code.

## Debugging Ownership Issues

Learning to work with Rust's ownership system is one of the biggest challenges for new Rust programmers. Let's look at common issues and how to solve them.

### Common Compiler Errors

1. **Use of moved value**:

   ```
   error[E0382]: use of moved value: `s1`
   ```

2. **Cannot move out of borrowed content**:

   ```
   error[E0507]: cannot move out of borrowed content
   ```

3. **Partial move**:
   ```
   error[E0382]: use of partially moved value
   ```

### Debugging Techniques

1. **Follow the compiler errors**: Rust's error messages are detailed and helpful
2. **Visualize ownership**: Draw diagrams of which variables own which values
3. **Use the `dbg!` macro**: See what's happening at each step
4. **Add type annotations**: Clarify the types of expressions
5. **Use `clone` temporarily**: If you're stuck, clone values to debug (then optimize later)

### Example of Debugging

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    // Problem: Trying to use s1 after move
    let s2 = s1;

    // This will cause an error:
    // println!("{}", s1);

    // Debug with dbg! and clone:
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    dbg!(&s1); // Use a reference to avoid moving
    let s2 = s1.clone(); // Use clone during debugging
    dbg!(s1, s2); // Now both are valid
}
```

## 🔨 Project: Memory Visualizer

Let's build a memory visualizer tool that helps illustrate ownership transfers in Rust. This project will create visual representations of stack and heap memory.

### Project Requirements

1. Represent variables on the stack
2. Represent heap allocations
3. Visualize ownership transfers
4. Show when values are dropped
5. Provide a simple API for tracking memory events

### Step 1: Create the Project

```bash
cargo new memory_visualizer
cd memory_visualizer
```

### Step 2: Define the Memory Events

We'll create a system that tracks memory events like allocations, moves, and drops.

```rust
// src/main.rs
use std::fmt;

enum MemoryLocation {
    Stack,
    Heap,
}

enum MemoryEvent {
    Allocate {
        variable: String,
        location: MemoryLocation,
        value: String,
        address: usize,
    },
    Move {
        from: String,
        to: String,
        address: usize,
    },
    Copy {
        from: String,
        to: String,
        value: String,
    },
    Drop {
        variable: String,
        address: Option<usize>,
    },
}

struct MemoryTracker {
    events: Vec<MemoryEvent>,
    variables: Vec<(String, Option<usize>)>, // (variable_name, heap_address_if_any)
}

impl MemoryTracker {
    fn new() -> Self {
        MemoryTracker {
            events: Vec::new(),
            variables: Vec::new(),
        }
    }

    fn allocate_stack(&mut self, variable: &str, value: &str) {
        self.events.push(MemoryEvent::Allocate {
            variable: variable.to_string(),
            location: MemoryLocation::Stack,
            value: value.to_string(),
            address: 0, // Stack address not tracked in this simple model
        });
        self.variables.push((variable.to_string(), None));
    }

    fn allocate_heap(&mut self, variable: &str, value: &str) {
        // Simulate a heap address with the variable's memory address
        let address = variable.as_ptr() as usize;
        self.events.push(MemoryEvent::Allocate {
            variable: variable.to_string(),
            location: MemoryLocation::Heap,
            value: value.to_string(),
            address,
        });
        self.variables.push((variable.to_string(), Some(address)));
    }

    fn move_ownership(&mut self, from: &str, to: &str) {
        // Find the address of the 'from' variable
        let address = self.variables
            .iter()
            .find(|(var, _)| var == from)
            .and_then(|(_, addr)| *addr);

        if let Some(addr) = address {
            self.events.push(MemoryEvent::Move {
                from: from.to_string(),
                to: to.to_string(),
                address: addr,
            });

            // Update the tracker: remove ownership from 'from'
            if let Some(pos) = self.variables.iter().position(|(var, _)| var == from) {
                self.variables.remove(pos);
            }
            self.variables.push((to.to_string(), Some(addr)));
        }
    }

    fn copy_value(&mut self, from: &str, to: &str, value: &str) {
        self.events.push(MemoryEvent::Copy {
            from: from.to_string(),
            to: to.to_string(),
            value: value.to_string(),
        });
        self.variables.push((to.to_string(), None));
    }

    fn drop_variable(&mut self, variable: &str) {
        // Find if the variable has a heap allocation
        let address = self.variables
            .iter()
            .find(|(var, _)| var == variable)
            .and_then(|(_, addr)| *addr);

        self.events.push(MemoryEvent::Drop {
            variable: variable.to_string(),
            address,
        });

        // Remove from tracker
        if let Some(pos) = self.variables.iter().position(|(var, _)| var == variable) {
            self.variables.remove(pos);
        }
    }

    fn visualize(&self) {
        for (i, event) in self.events.iter().enumerate() {
            println!("Event {}:", i + 1);
            match event {
                MemoryEvent::Allocate { variable, location, value, address } => {
                    let loc = match location {
                        MemoryLocation::Stack => "stack",
                        MemoryLocation::Heap => "heap",
                    };
                    println!("  Allocated '{}' on the {} with value '{}' at address {:x}",
                        variable, loc, value, address);
                    self.draw_memory_after_event(i);
                },
                MemoryEvent::Move { from, to, address } => {
                    println!("  Moved ownership from '{}' to '{}' for value at address {:x}",
                        from, to, address);
                    self.draw_memory_after_event(i);
                },
                MemoryEvent::Copy { from, to, value } => {
                    println!("  Copied value '{}' from '{}' to '{}'", value, from, to);
                    self.draw_memory_after_event(i);

                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Main Examples

Now let's implement some examples to demonstrate ownership:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Example 1: Stack values and Copy
    println!("Example 1: Stack values and Copy");
    {
        let mut tracker = MemoryTracker::new();

        // let x = 5;
        tracker.allocate_stack("x", "5");

        // let y = x; (copy, not move)
        tracker.copy_value("x", "y", "5");

        // End of scope, variables are dropped
        tracker.drop_variable("y");
        tracker.drop_variable("x");

        tracker.visualize();
    }

    // Example 2: Heap values and moves
    println!("\nExample 2: Heap values and Move semantics");
    {
        let mut tracker = MemoryTracker::new();

        // let s1 = String::from("hello");
        tracker.allocate_heap("s1", "hello");

        // let s2 = s1; (move, not copy)
        tracker.move_ownership("s1", "s2");

        // End of scope, variables are dropped
        tracker.drop_variable("s2"); // This also frees the heap memory

        tracker.visualize();
    }

    // Example 3: Clone
    println!("\nExample 3: Cloning heap values");
    {
        let mut tracker = MemoryTracker::new();

        // let s1 = String::from("hello");
        tracker.allocate_heap("s1", "hello");

        // let s2 = s1.clone();
        let s2_addr = "s2".as_ptr() as usize;
        tracker.events.push(MemoryEvent::Allocate {
            variable: "s2".to_string(),
            location: MemoryLocation::Heap,
            value: "hello".to_string(),
            address: s2_addr,
        });
        tracker.variables.push(("s2".to_string(), Some(s2_addr)));

        // End of scope
        tracker.drop_variable("s1");
        tracker.drop_variable("s2");

        tracker.visualize();
    }

    // Example 4: Function calls and ownership
    println!("\nExample 4: Function calls and ownership");
    {
        let mut tracker = MemoryTracker::new();

        // let s = String::from("hello");
        tracker.allocate_heap("s", "hello");

        // takes_ownership(s);
        tracker.move_ownership("s", "some_string");
        tracker.drop_variable("some_string"); // Function scope ends

        // let x = 5;
        tracker.allocate_stack("x", "5");

        // makes_copy(x);
        tracker.copy_value("x", "some_integer", "5");
        tracker.drop_variable("some_integer"); // Function scope ends

        // x is still valid here but s is not
        tracker.drop_variable("x");

        tracker.visualize();
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Build and Run the Memory Visualizer

When you run the program, you'll see a visualization of memory events for each example:

```
Example 1: Stack values and Copy
Event 1:
  Allocated 'x' on the stack with value '5' at address 0

  Memory state after event:
  +-------------------+      +-------------------+
  |       Stack       |      |       Heap        |
  +-------------------+      +-------------------+
  | x: 5 |
  +-------------------+      +-------------------+
                            +-------------------+

Event 2:
  Copied value '5' from 'x' to 'y'

  Memory state after event:
  +-------------------+      +-------------------+
  |       Stack       |      |       Heap        |
  +-------------------+      +-------------------+
  | x: 5 |
  | y: 5 |
  +-------------------+      +-------------------+
                            +-------------------+

...
```

### Step 5: Enhancing the Visualizer

Here are some ways you could extend the memory visualizer:

1. **Support for references**: Add the ability to track borrowed values
2. **Interactive mode**: Let users step through code examples and see memory changes
3. **GUI interface**: Create a graphical visualization of memory
4. **More complex examples**: Demonstrate ownership in structs, enums, and collections
5. **Export options**: Save visualizations as images or animations

### Step 6: Using the Visualizer for Learning

The memory visualizer is a powerful learning tool that helps you:

1. **Understand ownership visually**: See what happens to memory when values move
2. **Develop an intuition**: Build a mental model of Rust's memory management
3. **Debug ownership issues**: Visualize problematic code patterns
4. **Explain to others**: Use the visualizations to teach Rust concepts

## Summary

In this chapter, we've explored Rust's ownership system, which provides memory safety without garbage collection. We've covered:

- Different approaches to memory management across programming languages
- Why memory management is crucial for performance, safety, and reliability
- Rust's ownership rules and how they prevent common programming errors
- The stack and heap memory regions
- Variable scope and automatic cleanup
- Move semantics and ownership transfer
- The distinction between Copy and Clone
- Techniques for debugging ownership issues
- A memory visualizer project that illustrates ownership concepts

Understanding ownership is fundamental to mastering Rust. While the rules may seem restrictive at first, they enable Rust to provide memory safety guarantees that are impossible in languages with manual memory management or garbage collection.

In the next chapter, we'll build on this foundation to explore references and borrowing, which allow you to use values without taking ownership of them.

## Exercises

1. Extend the memory visualizer to support references and borrowing
2. Create a program that demonstrates the difference between Copy and Clone with various types
3. Write a function that takes ownership of a value and returns it, then trace the ownership flow
4. Implement a custom type that cannot be copied but can be cloned
5. Create a program with a deliberate ownership error, then fix it in multiple different ways
6. Visualize ownership in a more complex structure like a binary tree or linked list
7. Experiment with ownership in closures and explain how captures work
8. Compare the performance of copying vs. cloning for different sizes of data
