## Publication Strategy

**Weekly Schedule (15 weeks - approximately 4 months):**

- Monday: Post main article
- Wednesday: Share a code snippet expanding on the article
- Friday: Post a poll or question related to the topic to encourage engagement

**Content Enhancement Tips:**

1. Include real-world examples from your Noor project where relevant
2. Create short code snippets (<20 lines) for each article
3. End each article with a question to encourage comments
4. Use LinkedIn's carousel feature for code examples with explanations
5. Tag relevant Rust community members for increased visibility

**Performance Tracking:**

- Monitor engagement metrics (views, likes, comments)
- Adjust topics based on which articles generate the most interest
- Compile the most successful articles as potential book chapter previews
