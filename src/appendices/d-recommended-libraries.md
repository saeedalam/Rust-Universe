### How to Choose Crates

When evaluating a crate for your project, consider these factors:

1. **Maintenance status**: Check recent commits and releases
2. **Documentation quality**: Well-documented APIs are easier to use
3. **Community adoption**: Popular crates tend to be better maintained
4. **Dependency footprint**: Check what dependencies it brings in
5. **License compatibility**: Ensure it's compatible with your project
6. **API stability**: Check for breaking changes between versions
7. **Performance characteristics**: Look for benchmarks or performance claims
8. **Security record**: For security-critical crates, check vulnerability history
