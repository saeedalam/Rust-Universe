**Closure**: An anonymous function that can capture values from its environment.

**Coherence**: The property that there is at most one implementation of a trait for any given type.

**Compile-time**: Operations performed during compilation rather than when the program runs.

**Const Generics**: Generic parameters that represent constant values rather than types.

**Deref Coercion**: Automatic conversion from a reference to a type that implements `Deref` to a reference to the target type.

**Derive**: Automatically implementing traits through the `#[derive]` attribute.

**Discriminant**: The value used to determine which variant of an enum is active.

**Drop Check**: The compiler mechanism that ensures values aren't dropped while references to them still exist.

**DST (Dynamically Sized Type)**: A type whose size is not known at compile time, like slices (`[T]`) or trait objects.

**Dynamic Dispatch**: Late binding of method calls based on the actual type of an object, used with trait objects.

### E

**Edition**: A version of the Rust language that may include backwards-incompatible changes. Current editions include 2015, 2018, and 2021.

**Enum**: A type representing a value that can be one of several variants.

**Error Propagation**: Passing errors up the call stack, often using the `?` operator.

**Expression**: A piece of code that evaluates to a value.

**Extern Crate**: A declaration that the current crate depends on an external crate.

### F

**Feature Flag**: A conditional compilation option specified in Cargo.toml.

**Foreign Function Interface (FFI)**: The mechanism for calling functions written in other languages.

**Future**: A value representing an asynchronous computation that may not have completed yet.

**Fn Traits**: The family of traits (`Fn`, `FnMut`, `FnOnce`) that closures and functions implement.

### G

**Generics**: Parameters in types, functions, and traits that allow code to operate on different types.

**Guard Pattern**: Using RAII to ensure cleanup code runs when a value goes out of scope.

### H

**Higher-Ranked Trait Bounds (HRTB)**: A trait bound that uses the `for<'a>` syntax to specify a bound for all possible lifetimes.

### I

**Immutability**: By default, variables in Rust cannot be changed after being assigned.

**Implementation**: Code that provides behavior for a struct, enum, or trait.

**Interior Mutability**: The ability to mutate data even through a shared reference using types like `RefCell` or `Mutex`.

**Iterator**: A type that produces a sequence of values, implementing the `Iterator` trait.

### L

**Lifetime**: A compiler construct that ensures references are valid for a specific scope.

**Lifetime Elision**: Rules that allow omitting lifetime annotations in common patterns.

**Library Crate**: A crate that provides functionality to be used by other crates rather than being an executable.

### M

**Macro**: A way to define code that generates other code at compile time.

**Match**: A control flow construct that compares a value against patterns and executes code based on which pattern matches.

**Method**: A function associated with a type that takes `self` as its first parameter.

**MIRI**: An interpreter for Rust's mid-level IR (MIR) that can detect certain types of undefined behavior.

**Module**: A namespace that contains items such as functions, types, and other modules.

**Move Semantics**: When a value is assigned or passed to a function, ownership is transferred by default.

**Mutability**: The ability to change a value after its initial assignment.

**Mutex**: A synchronization primitive that protects shared data in concurrent contexts.

### N

**Never Type (`!`)**: The type of computations that never complete normally (e.g., a function that always panics).

**Newtype Pattern**: Wrapping a type in a single-field tuple struct to create a new type.

**Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL)**: An improvement to the borrow checker that allows references to be valid for just the portions of code where they're actually used.

### O

**Orphan Rule**: The rule that implementations of a trait can only be defined in the crate where either the trait or the type is defined.

**Owned Type**: A type that has a single owner responsible for its cleanup.

**Ownership**: Rust's core memory management concept where each value has a single owner.

### P

**Panic**: An unrecoverable error that typically results in thread termination.

**Pattern Matching**: Checking a value against patterns and extracting parts of it.

**Pin**: A wrapper type that prevents the underlying value from being moved in memory, used with `Future`s.

**Prelude**: The set of items automatically imported into every Rust module.

**Procedural Macro**: A function that takes code as input and produces code as output, used for custom derive, attribute-like macros, and function-like macros.

### R

**Raw Pointer**: An unsafe pointer type (`*const T` or `*mut T`) with no safety guarantees.

**Rc**: Reference Counted pointer (`Rc<T>`), a single-threaded shared ownership smart pointer.

**Recursive Type**: A type that can contain itself, like a tree structure.

**Reference**: A non-owning pointer to a value (`&T` or `&mut T`).

**RefCell**: A type that provides interior mutability in single-threaded contexts.

**Rustdoc**: Rust's documentation generation tool.

**Rustfmt**: A tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines.

### S

**Send**: A marker trait indicating a type can be safely transferred between threads.

**Slice**: A view into a contiguous sequence of elements (`[T]`).

**Smart Pointer**: A data structure that acts like a pointer but provides additional functionality.

**Static Dispatch**: Resolving function calls at compile time, used with generics and trait bounds.

**Static Lifetime (`'static`)**: The lifetime that lasts for the entire program.

**String Literal**: A fixed string in the source code, has type `&'static str`.

**String Type**: The owned, growable string type (`String`).

**Struct**: A custom data type that groups related values.

**Sync**: A marker trait indicating a type can be safely shared between threads.

### T

**Trait**: A feature similar to interfaces in other languages, defining shared behavior.

**Trait Bound**: A constraint on a generic type requiring it to implement certain traits.

**Trait Object**: A value that implements a specific trait, with type erased.

**Type Alias**: A new name for an existing type.

**Type Inference**: The compiler's ability to deduce types without explicit annotations.

### U

**Unsafe**: A keyword that marks code that bypasses some of Rust's safety guarantees.

**Unwrap**: Extracting the value from an `Option` or `Result`, causing a panic if there isn't one.

### V

**Variable Shadowing**: Declaring a new variable with the same name as an existing one.

**Variance**: How the subtyping relationship of parameters affects the subtyping relationship of the parametrized type.

**Vec**: Rust's dynamic array type (`Vec<T>`).

### W

**Wrapper Type**: A type that contains another type to add behavior or meaning.
