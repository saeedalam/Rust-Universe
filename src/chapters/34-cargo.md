# Chapter 34: Package Management with Cargo

## Introduction

Cargo is Rust's integrated package manager and build system, serving as the foundation of the Rust ecosystem. While we've used Cargo throughout this book for basic project management, this chapter will explore its more advanced capabilities and how it enables robust package management for Rust projects.

Unlike many programming languages where the build system and package manager are separate tools, Cargo unifies these functions into a single, coherent system. This integration creates a streamlined workflow that handles everything from dependency resolution and compilation to testing, documentation generation, and publishing packages. Whether you're building a small utility or a complex application with dozens of dependencies, Cargo provides the tools you need to manage your project effectively.

In this chapter, we'll dive deep into Cargo's capabilities, exploring how to effectively manage dependencies, structure multi-package projects, leverage Cargo features for conditional compilation, and publish your own packages to crates.io. We'll also examine how Cargo's extension system allows the community to build powerful tools that enhance the core functionality.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of Cargo's advanced features and how to leverage them to create maintainable, production-ready Rust projects.

## Project: Custom Cargo Plugin

In this project, we'll develop a custom Cargo plugin that extends Cargo with a new subcommand. Cargo plugins are standalone executables that integrate with Cargo's command-line interface, allowing you to add new functionality to your workflow.

We'll create a plugin called `cargo-docstat` that analyzes your crate's documentation coverage and provides statistics on how well your code is documented. This tool will help you improve your crate's documentation, making it more accessible to users.

### Understanding Cargo Plugins

Cargo plugins are simply executable programs with names that start with `cargo-`. When a user runs `cargo <command>`, Cargo first checks if it has a built-in subcommand with that name. If not, it looks for an executable named `cargo-<command>` in the user's PATH.

For example, when a user runs `cargo docstat`, Cargo will execute the `cargo-docstat` binary.

### Project Setup

Let's start by creating a new binary crate for our plugin:

```bash
cargo new --bin cargo-docstat
cd cargo-docstat
```

We'll need several dependencies for our plugin. Update the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[package]
name = "cargo-docstat"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
description = "A Cargo plugin to analyze documentation coverage"
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"

[dependencies]
clap = { version = "4.3", features = ["derive"] }
anyhow = "1.0"
cargo_metadata = "0.15"
syn = { version = "2.0", features = ["full", "extra-traits", "visit"] }
proc-macro2 = "1.0"
colored = "2.0"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

### Creating the Command-Line Interface

First, let's create a command-line interface for our plugin using `clap`:

```rust
// src/main.rs
use anyhow::{Context, Result};
use clap::{Parser, Subcommand};
use colored::Colorize;

#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name = "cargo")]
#[command(bin_name = "cargo")]
enum Cargo {
    #[command(name = "docstat")]
    DocStat(DocStatArgs),
}

#[derive(Parser)]
struct DocStatArgs {
    /// Path to Cargo.toml
    #[arg(long)]
    manifest_path: Option<String>,

    /// Generate JSON output
    #[arg(long)]
    json: bool,

    /// Check public items only
    #[arg(long)]
    public_only: bool,

    /// Fail if documentation coverage is below threshold (0-100)
    #[arg(long)]
    min_coverage: Option<f64>,
}

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let Cargo::DocStat(args) = Cargo::parse();

    println!("{} Analyzing documentation coverage...", "Cargo DocStat:".green().bold());

    let stats = analyze_docs(&args)?;
    print_stats(&stats, args.json)?;

    if let Some(min) = args.min_coverage {
        if stats.coverage < min {
            anyhow::bail!(
                "Documentation coverage is {:.1}%, which is below the minimum threshold of {:.1}%",
                stats.coverage,
                min
            );
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}

#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
struct DocStats {
    total_items: usize,
    documented_items: usize,
    coverage: f64,
    per_file: Vec<FileStats>,
}

#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
struct FileStats {
    path: String,
    total_items: usize,
    documented_items: usize,
    coverage: f64,
}

fn analyze_docs(args: &DocStatArgs) -> Result<DocStats> {
    // We'll implement this function next
    todo!()
}

fn print_stats(stats: &DocStats, json: bool) -> Result<()> {
    if json {
        println!("{}", serde_json::to_string_pretty(stats)?);
        return Ok(());
    }

    println!("Documentation Coverage: {:.1}%", stats.coverage);
    println!("Documented Items: {}/{}", stats.documented_items, stats.total_items);

    println!("\nPer-file Coverage:");
    for file in &stats.per_file {
        let coverage_color = if file.coverage >= 90.0 {
            "green"
        } else if file.coverage >= 70.0 {
            "yellow"
        } else {
            "red"
        };

        println!(
            "  {} - {:.1}% ({}/{})",
            file.path,
            file.coverage.to_string().color(coverage_color),
            file.documented_items,
            file.total_items
        );
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### Implementing Documentation Analysis

Now let's implement the core functionality to analyze the documentation coverage:

```rust
// Add these imports at the top of src/main.rs
use cargo_metadata::{Metadata, MetadataCommand};
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;
use syn::{visit::{self, Visit}, Item, ItemFn, ItemStruct, ItemEnum, ItemTrait, ItemImpl};

fn analyze_docs(args: &DocStatArgs) -> Result<DocStats> {
    // Get cargo metadata to find all the Rust source files
    let metadata = get_metadata(args)?;
    let package = metadata.packages.iter()
        .find(|p| p.id == metadata.resolve.as_ref().unwrap().root.as_ref().unwrap())
        .context("Could not find root package")?;

    let src_dir = Path::new(&package.manifest_path).parent().unwrap().join("src");

    let mut stats = DocStats {
        total_items: 0,
        documented_items: 0,
        coverage: 0.0,
        per_file: Vec::new(),
    };

    // Recursively find all Rust files
    visit_rust_files(&src_dir, args, &mut stats)?;

    // Calculate overall coverage
    if stats.total_items > 0 {
        stats.coverage = (stats.documented_items as f64 / stats.total_items as f64) * 100.0;
    }

    Ok(stats)
}

fn get_metadata(args: &DocStatArgs) -> Result<Metadata> {
    let mut cmd = MetadataCommand::new();

    if let Some(path) = &args.manifest_path {
        cmd.manifest_path(path);
    }

    cmd.exec().context("Failed to execute cargo metadata")
}

fn visit_rust_files(dir: &Path, args: &DocStatArgs, stats: &mut DocStats) -> Result<()> {
    if !dir.is_dir() {
        return Ok(());
    }

    for entry in fs::read_dir(dir)? {
        let entry = entry?;
        let path = entry.path();

        if path.is_dir() {
            visit_rust_files(&path, args, stats)?;
        } else if path.extension().map_or(false, |ext| ext == "rs") {
            analyze_file(&path, args, stats)?;
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}

fn analyze_file(path: &Path, args: &DocStatArgs, stats: &mut DocStats) -> Result<()> {
    // Read and parse the file
    let content = fs::read_to_string(path)?;
    let file = syn::parse_file(&content)?;

    // Create a visitor to count documented items
    let mut visitor = DocVisitor {
        total_items: 0,
        documented_items: 0,
        public_only: args.public_only,
    };

    // Visit the file to collect stats
    visitor.visit_file(&file);

    // Add file stats
    let coverage = if visitor.total_items > 0 {
        (visitor.documented_items as f64 / visitor.total_items as f64) * 100.0
    } else {
        100.0
    };

    let rel_path = path.strip_prefix(Path::new("").canonicalize()?)?;

    stats.per_file.push(FileStats {
        path: rel_path.to_string_lossy().to_string(),
        total_items: visitor.total_items,
        documented_items: visitor.documented_items,
        coverage,
    });

    // Update overall stats
    stats.total_items += visitor.total_items;
    stats.documented_items += visitor.documented_items;

    Ok(())
}

struct DocVisitor {
    total_items: usize,
    documented_items: usize,
    public_only: bool,
}

impl<'ast> Visit<'ast> for DocVisitor {
    fn visit_item(&mut self, item: &'ast Item) {
        // Check documentation for different item types
        match item {
            Item::Fn(item_fn) => self.check_item(item_fn.attrs.as_slice(), item_fn.vis.is_public()),
            Item::Struct(item_struct) => self.check_item(item_struct.attrs.as_slice(), item_struct.vis.is_public()),
            Item::Enum(item_enum) => self.check_item(item_enum.attrs.as_slice(), item_enum.vis.is_public()),
            Item::Trait(item_trait) => self.check_item(item_trait.attrs.as_slice(), item_trait.vis.is_public()),
            Item::Impl(item_impl) => self.check_impl(item_impl),
            // Add other item types as needed
            _ => {}
        }

        // Continue visiting nested items
        visit::visit_item(self, item);
    }
}

impl DocVisitor {
    fn check_item(&mut self, attrs: &[syn::Attribute], is_public: bool) {
        // Skip private items if only checking public items
        if self.public_only && !is_public {
            return;
        }

        self.total_items += 1;

        // Check if the item has documentation
        if attrs.iter().any(|attr| attr.path().is_ident("doc")) {
            self.documented_items += 1;
        }
    }

    fn check_impl(&mut self, item_impl: &ItemImpl) {
        // Only check trait implementations with doc comments
        if item_impl.trait_.is_some() {
            self.check_item(item_impl.attrs.as_slice(), true);
        }

        // No need to visit nested items in impl blocks, as they'll be visited separately
    }
}

// Helper extension trait to check if an item is public
trait VisExt {
    fn is_public(&self) -> bool;
}

impl VisExt for syn::Visibility {
    fn is_public(&self) -> bool {
        matches!(self, syn::Visibility::Public(_))
    }
}
```

### Testing the Plugin

Let's test our plugin on itself:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run -- docstat
```

This should analyze the documentation coverage of our `cargo-docstat` crate itself.

### Installing the Plugin

To install the plugin so that it can be used from anywhere, run:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Now you can use it as a cargo subcommand:

```bash
cargo docstat
```

### Plugin Features

Our plugin has several useful features:

1. **Documentation coverage statistics**: See what percentage of your code is documented
2. **Per-file breakdown**: Identify files that need more documentation
3. **JSON output**: Use the `--json` flag to get machine-readable output for CI integration
4. **Coverage threshold**: Use `--min-coverage 80` to fail the build if documentation coverage is below 80%
5. **Public API focus**: Use `--public-only` to focus on documenting your public API

### Extending the Plugin

There are many ways to extend this plugin:

- Add specific recommendations for improving documentation
- Integrate with GitHub Actions or other CI systems
- Add support for checking documentation quality using NLP techniques
- Generate documentation coverage badges

### Publishing the Plugin

Once you're satisfied with your plugin, you can publish it to crates.io:

```bash
cargo publish
```

Users can then install it with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-docstat
```

### Conclusion

By building this cargo plugin, we've learned how to extend Cargo's functionality with custom commands. The plugin system is one of Cargo's most powerful features, allowing the community to build specialized tools that integrate seamlessly with the standard workflow.

This project demonstrates many of the concepts we've covered in this chapter, including:

- Creating a package with appropriate dependencies
- Setting up the proper metadata for publishing
- Building a command-line interface
- Processing Rust source code
- Providing useful output for users

As you develop more complex Rust projects, consider creating custom cargo plugins to streamline your workflow and automate repetitive tasks.

## Summary

In this chapter, we've explored the advanced capabilities of Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system. We've covered:

- **Cargo in depth**: Understanding the fundamental concepts behind Cargo and how it manages Rust projects
- **Dependency management**: Strategies for effectively managing project dependencies, including version constraints, git dependencies, and path dependencies
- **Semantic versioning**: How Cargo uses SemVer to manage compatibility between packages and handle updates
- **Workspace management**: Organizing multi-package projects into workspaces for better maintainability and shared dependencies
- **Cargo features**: Using conditional compilation to create flexible packages that can be customized by consumers
- **Private dependencies**: Working with internal or proprietary code that isn't published to public registries
- **Publishing to crates.io**: The process of preparing and publishing packages to the central Rust package registry
- **Documentation generation**: Creating comprehensive documentation for your projects with rustdoc and Cargo
- **Cargo plugins and extensions**: Enhancing Cargo's functionality with community-built tools
- **Advanced Cargo.toml configuration**: Fine-tuning project settings for optimal builds and workflow
- **Cargo workspaces for monorepos**: Managing large codebases with multiple related packages

Cargo's thoughtful design and powerful capabilities make it one of Rust's greatest strengths as a programming language. By mastering these advanced features, you can create more maintainable, adaptable, and user-friendly Rust projects. The integration of package management, build processes, and documentation into a single coherent system eliminates many of the friction points that exist in other programming ecosystems.

As you continue your journey with Rust, remember that Cargo is not just a tool but a philosophy: dependencies should be explicit, versions should be managed carefully, and the build system should provide a consistent, reproducible workflow from development to production.

## Exercises

1. **Dependency Analysis**: Create a visualization of your project's dependency tree using `cargo tree`. Identify any potential issues like duplicate dependencies or version conflicts.

2. **Feature Flags**: Design a crate with at least three feature flags that enable different functionality. Implement conditional compilation and write tests for each feature combination.

3. **Workspace Refactoring**: Take an existing single-crate project and refactor it into a workspace with at least three separate crates. Ensure all functionality still works as expected.

4. **Custom Build Script**: Write a custom build script (`build.rs`) that generates Rust code at compile time based on external data (like a JSON configuration file).

5. **Documentation Website**: Generate comprehensive documentation for a project using `cargo doc` and customize it with additional information, examples, and styling.

6. **Publishing Workflow**: Set up a complete workflow for publishing a crate, including version management, changelog generation, and automated tests before release.

7. **Private Registry**: Configure a project to use a private cargo registry in addition to crates.io for dependencies.

8. **Cargo Plugin**: Develop a simple cargo plugin that extends Cargo with a new subcommand to perform a useful task for your workflow.

9. **Profile Optimization**: Configure custom build profiles in Cargo.toml with different optimization levels and compare the performance of the resulting binaries.

10. **Monorepo Strategy**: Design a monorepo structure for a complex application with shared libraries, backend services, and frontend components.
