# Chapter 8: Borrowing and References

## Introduction

In the previous chapter, we explored Rust's ownership system, which ensures memory safety without a garbage collector. While ownership provides strong guarantees, transferring ownership can become cumbersome when we want to use a value in multiple parts of our code. This is where Rust's _borrowing_ system comes into play.

Borrowing allows you to use data without taking ownership of it. This concept is implemented through _references_, which are a fundamental feature of Rust. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- What references are and how they differ from ownership
- The two types of references: shared and mutable
- Rules enforced by Rust's borrow checker
- How Rust prevents common programming errors at compile time
- Common patterns for working with references
- How to build practical applications using references

## What is a Reference?

A reference is a way to refer to a value without taking ownership of it. Think of a reference as a pointer to a value that someone else owns.

### Creating References

We create a reference by using the `&` symbol:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    // Create a reference to s1
    let s1_ref = &s1;

    // We can use the reference to access the data
    println!("s1_ref: {}", s1_ref);

    // s1 still owns the string and is valid here
    println!("s1 is still valid: {}", s1);
}
```

In this example, `s1` owns the `String` value, while `s1_ref` is merely borrowing it. When `s1_ref` goes out of scope, nothing special happens because it doesn't own the data.

### References vs. Raw Pointers

Unlike raw pointers in languages like C and C++, Rust references are always valid. The compiler ensures references never point to deallocated memory or null. This is a key part of Rust's safety guarantees.

| Characteristic                   | Rust References | C/C++ Pointers |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Can be null                      | No              | Yes            |
| Must point to valid data         | Yes             | No             |
| Automatically dereferenced       | Yes             | No             |
| Lifetime checked at compile time | Yes             | No             |
| Arithmetic operations            | No              | Yes            |

### Memory Representation

In memory, a reference is simply a pointer to a value. It contains the memory address where the value is stored but doesn't own that memory.

```
    Stack                            Heap
+-------------+               +-------------+
| s1          | -----------> | "hello"     |
+-------------+               +-------------+
| s1_ref      | ------+
+-------------+       |
                      +------>
```

## Shared and Mutable References

Rust has two types of references:

1. **Shared references** (`&T`): Allow you to read but not modify the data
2. **Mutable references** (`&mut T`): Allow you to both read and modify the data

### Shared References

Shared references (also called immutable references) allow you to read but not modify the data they point to:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    // Shared reference
    let r1 = &s;
    let r2 = &s;

    // We can have multiple shared references
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);

    // The original value is still accessible
    println!("Original: {}", s);
}
```

You can have as many shared references as you want simultaneously, but they are all read-only.

### Mutable References

Mutable references allow you to modify the data they point to:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    // Mutable reference
    let r1 = &mut s;

    // We can modify the data through the reference
    r1.push_str(", world");

    println!("Modified: {}", r1); // Prints: "hello, world"

    // Note that we can't use s here until r1 goes out of scope
}
```

Mutable references have an important restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to a piece of data at a time.

## Reference Rules and the Borrow Checker

Rust enforces strict rules for references through the _borrow checker_:

1. You can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references to a piece of data at a given time
2. References must always be valid (they can never point to deallocated memory)

These rules prevent data races at compile time.

### The First Rule: Exclusivity of Mutable References

The first rule means:

- You can have multiple shared (immutable) references (`&T`)
- OR you can have exactly one mutable reference (`&mut T`)
- But never both at the same time

This prevents data races:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s;     // Shared reference
    let r2 = &s;     // Another shared reference - OK

    // This would cause a compile error:
    // let r3 = &mut s;  // ERROR: Cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it's also borrowed as immutable

    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);

    // r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point

    // This is OK because r1 and r2 are no longer in use:
    let r3 = &mut s;
    r3.push_str(", world");

    println!("{}", r3);
}
```

Rust's compiler tracks the scopes where references are used, not just where they're declared. This means a reference's scope ends after its last usage, allowing new borrows to begin.

### The Second Rule: No Dangling References

The second rule ensures that references always point to valid data:

```rust
fn main() {
    // This would cause a compile error:
    // let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

// This would cause a compile error:
// fn dangle() -> &String {
//     let s = String::from("hello");
//     &s  // ERROR: returns a reference to data owned by the current function
// } // s goes out of scope and is dropped, but we tried to return a reference to it
```

Rust prevents dangling references by checking that the data outlives any references to it.

## Visual Explanation of Borrowing

Let's visualize borrowing with immutable and mutable references:

### Shared Borrows Visualization

```
        +---+---+---+---+---+
s -----> | h | e | l | l | o |
        +---+---+---+---+---+
          ^               ^
          |               |
         r1              r2
```

Here, `s` owns the string, while `r1` and `r2` are borrowing it. This is allowed because both are shared (immutable) references.

### Mutable Borrow Visualization

```
        +---+---+---+---+---+
s -----> | h | e | l | l | o |
        +---+---+---+---+---+
          ^
          |
         r1 (mutable)
```

Here, `r1` is a mutable reference to the string owned by `s`. No other references (mutable or immutable) are allowed while `r1` is active.

## Preventing Data Races at Compile Time

A data race occurs when:

1. Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time
2. At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data
3. There's no synchronization mechanism being used

Rust's reference rules prevent data races at compile time, which is a remarkable achievement. Most languages can only detect data races at runtime or not at all.

### Data Race Prevention Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];

    // In a language like C++, this could cause a data race
    // if executed in parallel threads.
    // But in Rust, it's a compile-time error:

    // let data_ref1 = &data;
    // let data_ref2 = &mut data;  // ERROR: cannot borrow as mutable

    // This is fine - sequential access with clear ownership
    {
        let data_ref1 = &data;
        println!("Immutable: {:?}", data_ref1);
    } // data_ref1 goes out of scope

    {
        let data_ref2 = &mut data;
        data_ref2.push(4);
        println!("Mutable: {:?}", data_ref2);
    } // data_ref2 goes out of scope

    println!("Original: {:?}", data);
}
```

## Lifetimes Introduction

A lifetime is a compile-time feature in Rust that ensures references are valid for as long as they're used. Lifetimes are a deeper topic that we'll explore fully in Chapter 18, but it's important to understand the basic concept now.

### What Are Lifetimes?

Lifetimes describe the scope for which a reference is valid. The Rust compiler uses lifetimes to ensure that references don't outlive the data they refer to.

Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred by the compiler:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    {
        let s2 = String::from("world");
        let longest = get_longest(&s1, &s2);
        println!("Longest string: {}", longest);
    } // s2 goes out of scope, but longest is still valid because it's referring to s1

    // This is still valid because longest is referring to s1, which is still in scope
    println!("First string: {}", s1);
}

// The compiler infers the lifetimes here
fn get_longest(s1: &str, s2: &str) -> &str {
    if s1.len() > s2.len() {
        s1
    } else {
        s2
    }
}
```

In more complex scenarios, we need to explicitly annotate lifetimes, which we'll explore in a later chapter.

### Why Lifetimes Are Necessary

Lifetimes prevent dangling references by ensuring that referenced data outlives all references to it. Without lifetimes, Rust couldn't guarantee memory safety without a garbage collector.

```rust
// Without lifetimes, this function would be ambiguous:
// Which input parameter's lifetime should the return value follow?
fn longest<'a>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if s1.len() > s2.len() {
        s1
    } else {
        s2
    }
}
```

The lifetime annotation `'a` tells the compiler that the references `s1` and `s2` and the return value all share the same lifetime.

## Working with References

Let's look at some practical examples of working with references.

### Function Parameters as References

Using references as function parameters allows us to use values without taking ownership:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    // Pass a reference to the function
    let len = calculate_length(&s);

    // s is still valid here
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s, len);
}

// The function takes a reference to a String
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
} // s goes out of scope, but it doesn't have ownership, so nothing happens
```

### Mutable References in Functions

Functions can also take mutable references to modify the data:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    // Pass a mutable reference to the function
    append_world(&mut s);

    // s has been modified
    println!("Modified string: {}", s);
}

// The function takes a mutable reference
fn append_world(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(", world");
}
```

### Passing References to Methods

Methods often take `&self` or `&mut self` as their first parameter:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    // Takes an immutable reference to self
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    // Takes a mutable reference to self
    fn resize(&mut self, width: u32, height: u32) {
        self.width = width;
        self.height = height;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut rect = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!("Area: {}", rect.area());

    rect.resize(40, 60);
    println!("New area: {}", rect.area());
}
```

### Slice References

Slices are references to a portion of a collection:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];  // Reference to a part of s
    let world = &s[6..11]; // Another reference to part of s

    println!("{} {}", hello, world);

    // s is still valid and owns the string
    println!("Original: {}", s);
}
```

## Dangling References and How Rust Prevents Them

A dangling reference occurs when a reference points to memory that has been deallocated. Rust prevents this through compile-time checks:

```rust
fn main() {
    // This won't compile
    // let reference_to_nothing = dangle();

    // This is the correct approach
    let string = no_dangle();
    println!("{}", string);
}

// This function tries to return a reference to an internal value
// fn dangle() -> &String { // ERROR: missing lifetime specifier
//     let s = String::from("hello");
//     &s // We try to return a reference to s
// } // s goes out of scope and is dropped, so the reference would be invalid

// This function returns ownership of a new String
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    s // Return the String itself, transferring ownership
}
```

### Common Scenarios That Could Lead to Dangling References

1. **Returning a reference to a local variable:**

```rust
// This won't compile
// fn return_local_ref() -> &i32 {
//     let x = 5;
//     &x  // ERROR: x doesn't live long enough
// }
```

2. **Storing a reference to temporary data:**

```rust
// This won't compile
// fn main() {
//     let r;
//     {
//         let x = 5;
//         r = &x;  // ERROR: x doesn't live long enough
//     }
//     println!("{}", r);
// }
```

3. **Using references after releasing the resource:**

```rust
// This won't compile
// fn main() {
//     let s = String::from("hello");
//     let ref_to_s = &s;
//     drop(s);  // ERROR: cannot move s because it's borrowed
//     println!("{}", ref_to_s);
// }
```

Rust prevents all these scenarios through compile-time checks, making your code safer without runtime overhead.

## Common Borrowing Patterns

Let's look at some common patterns for using references in Rust.

### Temporary Borrowing for Calculations

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Borrow temporarily for a calculation
    let sum = calculate_sum(&data);
    println!("Sum: {}", sum);

    // Now we can modify the data
    data.push(6);

    // Borrow again for another calculation
    let new_sum = calculate_sum(&data);
    println!("New sum: {}", new_sum);
}

fn calculate_sum(numbers: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    numbers.iter().sum()
}
```

### Mutable Borrowing for Updates

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut user = User {
        name: String::from("Alice"),
        age: 30,
    };

    // Borrow user mutably to update age
    increment_age(&mut user);
    println!("{} is now {}", user.name, user.age);

    // Borrow mutably again for another update
    change_name(&mut user, "Alicia");
    println!("Updated name: {}", user.name);
}

struct User {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

fn increment_age(user: &mut User) {
    user.age += 1;
}

fn change_name(user: &mut User, new_name: &str) {
    user.name = String::from(new_name);
}
```

### Multiple Immutable Borrows

```rust
fn main() {
    let text = String::from("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog");

    // Multiple immutable borrows for different operations
    let word_count = count_words(&text);
    let char_count = count_chars(&text);
    let has_all_letters = contains_all_letters(&text);

    println!("Word count: {}", word_count);
    println!("Character count: {}", char_count);
    println!("Contains all letters: {}", has_all_letters);
}

fn count_words(text: &str) -> usize {
    text.split_whitespace().count()
}

fn count_chars(text: &str) -> usize {
    text.chars().count()
}

fn contains_all_letters(text: &str) -> bool {
    let text = text.to_lowercase();
    ('a'..='z').all(|c| text.contains(c))
}
```

### Split Borrows

Sometimes you need to borrow different parts of a structure at the same time:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Borrowing different parts of the vector at the same time
    let first = &mut numbers[0];
    let last = &mut numbers[numbers.len() - 1];

    // We can modify both independently
    *first += 10;
    *last *= 2;

    println!("First: {}, Last: {}", first, last);
    println!("All numbers: {:?}", numbers);
}
```

### Borrowing for Iteration

Iterating over collections often uses borrowing:

```rust
fn main() {
    let names = vec![
        String::from("Alice"),
        String::from("Bob"),
        String::from("Charlie"),
    ];

    // Borrow each name for printing
    for name in &names {
        println!("Hello, {}!", name);
    }

    // Names are still available
    println!("Names: {:?}", names);

    // Mutable iteration
    let mut scores = vec![10, 20, 30];
    
    // Borrow each score mutably
    for score in &mut scores {
        *score += 5;
    }

    println!("Updated scores: {:?}", scores);
}
```

## 🔨 Project: Text Analyzer

Let's build a text analyzer tool to practice using references. This tool will analyze text for various statistics without making unnecessary copies.

### Project Requirements

1. Count words, sentences, and paragraphs
2. Calculate average word length
3. Identify the most common words
4. Calculate readability scores
5. Support for analyzing different sections of text with references

### Step 1: Create the Project

```bash
cargo new text_analyzer
cd text_analyzer
```

### Step 2: Define the Analyzer Structure

Create `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::fs;

struct TextAnalyzer<'a> {
    text: &'a str,
}

impl<'a> TextAnalyzer<'a> {
    fn new(text: &'a str) -> Self {
        TextAnalyzer { text }
    }

    fn word_count(&self) -> usize {
        self.text.split_whitespace().count()
    }

    fn character_count(&self) -> usize {
        self.text.chars().count()
    }

    fn sentence_count(&self) -> usize {
        self.text
            .split(|c| c == '.' || c == '!' || c == '?')
            .filter(|s| !s.trim().is_empty())
            .count()
    }

    fn paragraph_count(&self) -> usize {
        self.text
            .split("\n\n")
            .filter(|p| !p.trim().is_empty())
            .count()
    }

    fn average_word_length(&self) -> f64 {
        let words: Vec<&str> = self.text.split_whitespace().collect();
        if words.is_empty() {
            return 0.0;
        }

        let total_length: usize = words.iter()
            .map(|word| word.chars().count())
            .sum();

        total_length as f64 / words.len() as f64
    }

    fn most_common_words(&self, limit: usize) -> Vec<(String, usize)> {
        let mut word_counts = HashMap::new();

        // Normalize and count words
        for word in self.text.split_whitespace() {
            let word = word.trim_matches(|c: char| !c.is_alphanumeric())
                .to_lowercase();

            if !word.is_empty() {
                *word_counts.entry(word).or_insert(0) += 1;
            }
        }

        // Convert to vector and sort
        let mut word_counts: Vec<(String, usize)> = word_counts.into_iter().collect();
        word_counts.sort_by(|a, b| b.1.cmp(&a.1));

        // Take top N words
        word_counts.truncate(limit);
        word_counts
    }

    fn flesch_kincaid_readability(&self) -> f64 {
        let word_count = self.word_count() as f64;
        if word_count == 0.0 {
            return 0.0;
        }

        let sentence_count = self.sentence_count() as f64;
        if sentence_count == 0.0 {
            return 0.0;
        }

        // Count syllables (approximation)
        let syllable_count = self.text
            .split_whitespace()
            .map(|word| count_syllables(word))
            .sum::<usize>() as f64;

        // Flesch-Kincaid formula: 206.835 - 1.015 * (words/sentences) - 84.6 * (syllables/words)
        206.835 - 1.015 * (word_count / sentence_count) - 84.6 * (syllable_count / word_count)
    }

    fn analyze_section(&self, start: usize, end: usize) -> TextAnalyzer {
        let start = start.min(self.text.len());
        let end = end.min(self.text.len());

        // Create a substring reference
        if let Some(section) = self.text.get(start..end) {
            TextAnalyzer::new(section)
        } else {
            TextAnalyzer::new("")
        }
    }
}

// Helper function to estimate syllable count
fn count_syllables(word: &str) -> usize {
    let word = word.trim_matches(|c: char| !c.is_alphanumeric())
        .to_lowercase();

    if word.is_empty() {
        return 0;
    }

    let vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'];
    let mut count = 0;
    let mut prev_is_vowel = false;

    for c in word.chars() {
        let is_vowel = vowels.contains(&c);
        if is_vowel && !prev_is_vowel {
            count += 1;
        }
        prev_is_vowel = is_vowel;
    }

    // Adjust for common patterns
    if word.ends_with('e') && count > 1 {
        count -= 1;
    }

    // Every word has at least one syllable
    count.max(1)
}

fn main() {
    // Read a sample text file
    let text = match fs::read_to_string("sample.txt") {
        Ok(content) => content,
        Err(_) => {
            // Provide a default text if file doesn't exist
            String::from(
                "This is a sample text for our text analyzer. \
                It contains multiple sentences! Some are short. Others are longer. \

    println!("Average word length: {:.2} characters", analyzer.average_word_length());
    println!("Readability score: {:.2}", analyzer.flesch_kincaid_readability());

    // Show most common words
    println!("\nMost common words:");
    for (i, (word, count)) in analyzer.most_common_words(5).iter().enumerate() {
        println!("{}. {} ({})", i + 1, word, count);
    }

    // Analyze first paragraph separately
    if analyzer.paragraph_count() > 1 {
        let first_para_end = text.find("\n\n").unwrap_or(text.len());
        let first_para = analyzer.analyze_section(0, first_para_end);

        println!("\nFirst Paragraph Analysis");
        println!("------------------------");
        println!("Word count: {}", first_para.word_count());
        println!("Sentence count: {}", first_para.sentence_count());
        println!("Average word length: {:.2} characters", first_para.average_word_length());
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Run the Text Analyzer

```bash
cargo run
```

### Step 4: Extend the Text Analyzer

Let's add a few more features to our text analyzer:

```rust
impl<'a> TextAnalyzer<'a> {
    // ... existing methods ...

    fn word_frequency(&self, word: &str) -> usize {
        let word = word.to_lowercase();
        self.text
            .split_whitespace()
            .map(|w| w.trim_matches(|c: char| !c.is_alphanumeric()).to_lowercase())
            .filter(|w| w == &word)
            .count()
    }

    fn unique_words(&self) -> usize {
        let mut unique = std::collections::HashSet::new();

        for word in self.text.split_whitespace() {
            let word = word.trim_matches(|c: char| !c.is_alphanumeric())
                .to_lowercase();

            if !word.is_empty() {
                unique.insert(word);
            }
        }

        unique.len()
    }

    fn summarize(&self, sentence_count: usize) -> String {
        let sentences: Vec<&str> = self.text
            .split(|c| c == '.' || c == '!' || c == '?')
            .filter(|s| !s.trim().is_empty())
            .collect();

        if sentences.is_empty() {
            return String::new();
        }

        let actual_count = sentence_count.min(sentences.len());
        let summary: String = sentences[0..actual_count]
            .iter()
            .map(|s| s.trim())
            .collect::<Vec<&str>>()
            .join(". ");

        summary + "."
    }
}
```

In `main()`, add:

```rust
// Add these lines to the main function
println!("\nUnique words: {}", analyzer.unique_words());
println!("\nFrequency of 'Rust': {}", analyzer.word_frequency("Rust"));
println!("\nSummary (2 sentences):\n{}", analyzer.summarize(2));
```

### Step 5: Understanding How the Project Uses References

Our text analyzer demonstrates several key concepts about references:

1. **Borrowing data**: The `TextAnalyzer` struct borrows the text without taking ownership
2. **Lifetime annotations**: We use lifetime parameters (`'a`) to tell the compiler that the reference in the struct is valid for the same lifetime as the struct itself
3. **Immutable references**: All our analysis is done with immutable references
4. **Reference slices**: The `analyze_section` method creates new analyzers that reference subsets of the text
5. **No copying needed**: We analyze the text without making unnecessary copies

### Step 6: Further Extensions

Here are some ways you could extend the text analyzer:

1. Add sentiment analysis to detect positive/negative tone
2. Implement keyword extraction
3. Add support for comparing multiple texts
4. Create visualizations of word frequency
5. Implement more advanced readability metrics

## Visualizing the Borrow Checker

Let's visualize how the borrow checker works with a simplified representation.

### Timeline Visualization

```
Timeline:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
Variable:  [----s--------------------]
Ref &r1:      [------]
Ref &r2:         [------]
Ref &mut r3:                [------]
```

This visualization shows:

- Variable `s` is valid from point 1 to point 8
- Reference `&r1` is valid from point 2 to point 5
- Reference `&r2` is valid from point 3 to point 6
- Mutable reference `&mut r3` is valid from point 6 to point 8

Note that `&r1` and `&r2` overlap (multiple shared references are allowed), but `&mut r3` doesn't overlap with any other reference (exclusive access).

### Code Equivalent

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello"); // Point 1: s is created

    // Point 2: r1 borrows s
    let r1 = &s;

    // Point 3: r2 also borrows s
    let r2 = &s;

    // Point 4-5: Using r1 and r2
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // Point 5-6: r1 and r2 are no longer used

    // Point 6: r3 mutably borrows s
    let r3 = &mut s;
    r3.push_str(", world");

    // Point 7: Using r3
    println!("{}", r3);
    // Point 8: End of scope, everything is dropped
}
```

### Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL)

In older versions of Rust, references were valid from their declaration until the end of their scope. With Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL), a reference's scope ends after its last use, which enables more flexible code patterns:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    // Read from v
    let first = &v[0];
    println!("First element: {}", first);
    // first is no longer used after this point

    // We can now modify v because first is no longer in use
    v.push(4);
    println!("Vector: {:?}", v);
}
```

### Mental Model for the Borrow Checker

Think of borrowing like a library book:

1. You can have any number of people reading the same book (shared references)
2. If someone is writing notes in the book (mutable reference), no one else can access it
3. The book must exist longer than any borrowers have it checked out

This mental model can help you understand and predict when the borrow checker will allow or reject your code.

## 🔨 Project: Text Analyzer

Let's build a text analyzer tool to practice using references. This tool will analyze text for various statistics without making unnecessary copies.

### Project Requirements

1. Count words, sentences, and paragraphs
2. Calculate average word length
3. Identify the most common words
4. Calculate readability scores
5. Support for analyzing different sections of text with references

### Step 1: Create the Project

```bash
cargo new text_analyzer
cd text_analyzer
```

### Step 2: Define the Analyzer Structure

Create `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::fs;

struct TextAnalyzer<'a> {
    text: &'a str,
}

impl<'a> TextAnalyzer<'a> {
    fn new(text: &'a str) -> Self {
        TextAnalyzer { text }
    }

    fn word_count(&self) -> usize {
        self.text.split_whitespace().count()
    }

    fn character_count(&self) -> usize {
        self.text.chars().count()
    }

    fn sentence_count(&self) -> usize {
        self.text
            .split(|c| c == '.' || c == '!' || c == '?')
            .filter(|s| !s.trim().is_empty())
            .count()
    }

    fn paragraph_count(&self) -> usize {
        self.text
            .split("\n\n")
            .filter(|p| !p.trim().is_empty())
            .count()
    }

    fn average_word_length(&self) -> f64 {
        let words: Vec<&str> = self.text.split_whitespace().collect();
        if words.is_empty() {
            return 0.0;
        }

        let total_length: usize = words.iter()
            .map(|word| word.chars().count())
            .sum();

        total_length as f64 / words.len() as f64
    }

    fn most_common_words(&self, limit: usize) -> Vec<(String, usize)> {
        let mut word_counts = HashMap::new();

        // Normalize and count words
        for word in self.text.split_whitespace() {
            let word = word.trim_matches(|c: char| !c.is_alphanumeric())
                .to_lowercase();

            if !word.is_empty() {
                *word_counts.entry(word).or_insert(0) += 1;
            }
        }

        // Convert to vector and sort
        let mut word_counts: Vec<(String, usize)> = word_counts.into_iter().collect();
        word_counts.sort_by(|a, b| b.1.cmp(&a.1));

        // Take top N words
        word_counts.truncate(limit);
        word_counts
    }

    fn flesch_kincaid_readability(&self) -> f64 {
        let word_count = self.word_count() as f64;
        if word_count == 0.0 {
            return 0.0;
        }

        let sentence_count = self.sentence_count() as f64;
        if sentence_count == 0.0 {
            return 0.0;
        }

        // Count syllables (approximation)
        let syllable_count = self.text
            .split_whitespace()
            .map(|word| count_syllables(word))
            .sum::<usize>() as f64;

        // Flesch-Kincaid formula: 206.835 - 1.015 * (words/sentences) - 84.6 * (syllables/words)
        206.835 - 1.015 * (word_count / sentence_count) - 84.6 * (syllable_count / word_count)
    }

    fn analyze_section(&self, start: usize, end: usize) -> TextAnalyzer {
        let start = start.min(self.text.len());
        let end = end.min(self.text.len());

        // Create a substring reference
        if let Some(section) = self.text.get(start..end) {
            TextAnalyzer::new(section)
        } else {
            TextAnalyzer::new("")
        }
    }
}

// Helper function to estimate syllable count
fn count_syllables(word: &str) -> usize {
    let word = word.trim_matches(|c: char| !c.is_alphanumeric())
        .to_lowercase();

    if word.is_empty() {
        return 0;
    }

    let vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'];
    let mut count = 0;
    let mut prev_is_vowel = false;

    for c in word.chars() {
        let is_vowel = vowels.contains(&c);
        if is_vowel && !prev_is_vowel {
            count += 1;
        }
        prev_is_vowel = is_vowel;
    }

    // Adjust for common patterns
    if word.ends_with('e') && count > 1 {
        count -= 1;
    }

    // Every word has at least one syllable
    count.max(1)
}

fn main() {
    // Read a sample text file
    let text = match fs::read_to_string("sample.txt") {
        Ok(content) => content,
        Err(_) => {
            // Provide a default text if file doesn't exist
            String::from(
                "This is a sample text for our text analyzer. \
                It contains multiple sentences! Some are short. Others are longer. \
                \n\n\
                This is a new paragraph. It demonstrates how our analyzer can count paragraphs. \
                How well can it analyze different texts? Let's find out.\
                \n\n\
                The Rust programming language helps developers create fast, reliable software. \
                It's becoming popular for systems programming, web development, and more."
            )
        }
    };

    // Create an analyzer with a reference to the text
    let analyzer = TextAnalyzer::new(&text);

    // Display basic statistics
    println!("Text Analysis Results");
    println!("--------------------");
    println!("Word count: {}", analyzer.word_count());
    println!("Character count: {}", analyzer.character_count());
    println!("Sentence count: {}", analyzer.sentence_count());
    println!("Paragraph count: {}", analyzer.paragraph_count());
    println!("Average word length: {:.2} characters", analyzer.average_word_length());
    println!("Readability score: {:.2}", analyzer.flesch_kincaid_readability());

    // Show most common words
    println!("\nMost common words:");
    for (i, (word, count)) in analyzer.most_common_words(5).iter().enumerate() {
        println!("{}. {} ({})", i + 1, word, count);
    }

    // Analyze first paragraph separately
    if analyzer.paragraph_count() > 1 {
        let first_para_end = text.find("\n\n").unwrap_or(text.len());
        let first_para = analyzer.analyze_section(0, first_para_end);

        println!("\nFirst Paragraph Analysis");
        println!("------------------------");
        println!("Word count: {}", first_para.word_count());
        println!("Sentence count: {}", first_para.sentence_count());
        println!("Average word length: {:.2} characters", first_para.average_word_length());
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Run the Text Analyzer

```bash
cargo run
```

You should see output with analysis of the sample text. If you want to analyze your own text, create a file named `sample.txt` in the project directory.

### Step 4: Add More Features

Let's enhance our text analyzer with a few more methods:

```rust
impl<'a> TextAnalyzer<'a> {
    // ... existing methods ...

    // Calculate what percentage of words are unique
    fn lexical_diversity(&self) -> f64 {
        let words: Vec<&str> = self.text.split_whitespace().collect();
        if words.is_empty() {
            return 0.0;
        }

        let mut unique_words = std::collections::HashSet::new();
        for word in words.iter() {
            let word = word.trim_matches(|c: char| !c.is_alphanumeric())
                .to_lowercase();
            if !word.is_empty() {
                unique_words.insert(word);
            }
        }

        unique_words.len() as f64 / words.len() as f64
    }

    // Find sentences containing a specific word
    fn find_sentences_with_word(&self, word: &str) -> Vec<String> {
        let word = word.to_lowercase();
        let sentences: Vec<&str> = self.text
            .split(|c| c == '.' || c == '!' || c == '?')
            .filter(|s| !s.trim().is_empty())
            .collect();

        sentences.iter()
            .filter(|s| s.to_lowercase().contains(&word))
            .map(|s| s.trim().to_string() + ".")
            .collect()
    }

    // Generate a summary by extracting important sentences
    fn generate_summary(&self, sentences_count: usize) -> String {
        let sentences: Vec<&str> = self.text
            .split(|c| c == '.' || c == '!' || c == '?')
            .filter(|s| !s.trim().is_empty())
            .collect();

        if sentences.is_empty() || sentences_count == 0 {
            return String::new();
        }

        // Simple algorithm: take the first N sentences
        // A more sophisticated approach would use word frequency to rank sentences
        let count = sentences_count.min(sentences.len());
        sentences[0..count].iter()
            .map(|s| s.trim().to_string())
            .collect::<Vec<String>>()
            .join(". ") + "."
    }
}
```

Let's update our `main` function to use these new features:

```rust
fn main() {
    // ... existing code ...

    // After the existing analysis, add:
    println!("\nLexical diversity: {:.2}", analyzer.lexical_diversity());
    println!("\nSummary (2 sentences):\n{}", analyzer.generate_summary(2));

    // Find sentences containing a specific word
    let search_word = "rust";
    let sentences = analyzer.find_sentences_with_word(search_word);
    println!("\nSentences containing '{}':", search_word);
    for (i, sentence) in sentences.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("{}. {}", i + 1, sentence);
    }

    // Interactive mode (optional)
    println!("\nEnter a word to search for (or press Enter to quit):");
    loop {
        let mut input = String::new();
        std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
        let input = input.trim();
        
        if input.is_empty() {
            break;
        }
        
        let sentences = analyzer.find_sentences_with_word(input);
        println!("Found {} sentences containing '{}':", sentences.len(), input);
        for (i, sentence) in sentences.iter().enumerate() {
            println!("{}. {}", i + 1, sentence);
        }
        
        println!("\nEnter another word (or press Enter to quit):");
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Understanding How References are Used

Our text analyzer demonstrates several key concepts about references:

1. **Borrowing data**: The `TextAnalyzer` struct borrows the text without taking ownership
2. **Lifetime annotations**: We use lifetime parameters (`'a`) to tell the compiler that the reference in the struct is valid for the same lifetime as the struct itself
3. **Immutable references**: All our analysis is done with immutable references, allowing us to create multiple analyzers for the same text
4. **Reference slices**: The `analyze_section` method creates new analyzers that reference subsets of the text
5. **No copying needed**: We analyze the text without making unnecessary copies, which is efficient for large texts

### Step 6: Further Improvements (Exercises)

Here are some ways you could extend the text analyzer:

1. Add sentiment analysis to detect positive/negative tone
2. Implement more advanced readability metrics (e.g., SMOG index, Coleman-Liau)
3. Add support for analyzing text from URLs or different file formats
4. Create visualizations of word frequency or sentence length
5. Implement text comparison features to compare multiple documents

## Summary

In this chapter, we've explored Rust's reference system, which allows us to borrow values without taking ownership. We've learned about:

- What references are and how they differ from raw pointers
- Shared and mutable references and their rules
- How the borrow checker prevents data races and memory safety issues
- The basic concept of lifetimes
- How to work with references in functions and methods
- Common borrowing patterns and how to visualize the borrow checker's rules
- Building a practical text analyzer application using references

References are a fundamental part of Rust's safety guarantees, and understanding them is essential for writing idiomatic Rust code. The text analyzer project has given us hands-on experience using references to efficiently analyze data without unnecessary copying.

In the next chapter, we'll build on our understanding of references as we explore strings and slices, which are special kinds of references that allow us to work with text and parts of collections.

## Exercises

1. Extend the text analyzer to count specific parts of speech (requires an external library or simple heuristics)
2. Implement a function that takes multiple mutable references to different parts of an array
3. Create a program that demonstrates how to share references between threads safely
4. Build a simple spell checker that uses references to a dictionary
5. Write a function that manipulates a string in-place using mutable references
6. Implement a simple linked list using references and lifetimes
7. Create a function that borrows two different data structures and compares them
8. Write a function that takes a closure as an argument and gives it a reference to some data
